Why Have Their COVID-19 Policies Differed?</h1> <p class="byline">By <a href="https://www.columbiaspectator.com/contributors/Derek-Ng/">Derek Ng</a></p> <p class="pub-date">November 11, 2022</p> </header> </div> <p class="cover-caption">Photo by Violet Mendelsund</p> <div class="g-body"> <p class="inline-credits"> </p> </div> <div class="story"> <p class="g-body paragraph"> In February, Sydney Gerlach, now a Barnard junior, submitted a petition to Barnard regarding its policies for mandatory masking indoors. She appealed on behalf of actors performing in a play she was producing at Barnard that semester—the New and Original Material Authored and Directed by Students, or NOMADS show—to perform maskless. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Gerlach’s frustrations about her actors having to wear masks while working on theater productions didn’t have to do with the mask itself. Obstructive as a mask can be for a stage production—it covers an actor’s face, after all—Gerlach recognized the importance of wearing a mask in helping stop the spread of COVID-19. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> What frustrated her was that, across the street, her classmates at Columbia were not held to the same standard. In March, the show Gerlach was working on was masked because it was held on Barnard’s campus. But at Columbia, theater productions, and other indoor activities such as athletic events, were unmasked. </p> <div class="graphic">   <style media="screen,print">#g-covidpolicies-web-box,#g-covidpolicies-web-box .g-artboard{margin:0 auto}#g-covidpolicies-web-box p{margin:0}#g-covidpolicies-web-box .g-aiAbs{position:absolute}#g-covidpolicies-web-box .g-aiImg{position:absolute;top:0;display:block;width:100%!important}#g-covidpolicies-web-box .g-aiSymbol{position:absolute;box-sizing:border-box}#g-covidpolicies-web-box .g-aiPointText p{white-space:nowrap}#g-covidpolicies-web-Artboard_1{position:relative;overflow:hidden}#g-covidpolicies-web-Artboard_1 p{font-family:Roboto,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;line-height:13px;opacity:1;letter-spacing:0;font-size:11px;text-align:left;color:#000;text-transform:none;padding-bottom:0;padding-top:0;mix-blend-mode:normal;font-style:normal;height:auto;position:static}#g-covidpolicies-web-Artboard_1 .g-pstyle0{font-weight:700;line-height:29px;font-size:24px;text-align:center}#g-covidpolicies-web-Artboard_1 .g-pstyle1{font-weight:700;line-height:12px;font-size:12px;text-align:justify;text-transform:uppercase}#g-covidpolicies-web-Artboard_1 .g-pstyle2{text-align:center}#g-covidpolicies-web-Artboard_1 .g-pstyle3{font-weight:700;line-height:14px;font-size:12px;text-align:justify;text-transform:uppercase}#g-covidpolicies-web-Artboard_2{position:relative;overflow:hidden}#g-covidpolicies-web-Artboard_2 p{font-family:Roboto,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;line-height:13px;opacity:1;letter-spacing:0;font-size:11px;text-align:left;color:#000;text-transform:none;padding-bottom:0;padding-top:0;mix-blend-mode:normal;font-style:normal;height:auto;position:static}#g-covidpolicies-web-Artboard_2 .g-pstyle0{font-weight:700;line-height:22px;font-size:18px;text-align:center}#g-covidpolicies-web-Artboard_2 .g-pstyle1{font-weight:700;line-height:12px;font-size:12px;text-align:justify;text-transform:uppercase}#g-covidpolicies-web-Artboard_2 .g-pstyle2{text-align:center}#g-covidpolicies-web-Artboard_2 .g-pstyle3{font-weight:700;line-height:14px;font-size:12px;text-align:justify;text-transform:uppercase}#g-covidpolicies-web-Artboard_3{position:relative;overflow:hidden}#g-covidpolicies-web-Artboard_3 p{font-family:Roboto,arial,helvetica,sans-serif;line-height:19px;opacity:1;letter-spacing:0;font-size:16px;text-align:left;color:#000;text-transform:none;padding-bottom:0;padding-top:0;mix-blend-mode:normal;font-style:normal;height:auto;position:static}#g-covidpolicies-web-Artboard_3 .g-pstyle0{font-weight:700;line-height:41px;font-size:34px;text-align:center}#g-covidpolicies-web-Artboard_3 .g-pstyle1{font-weight:700;line-height:12px;font-size:20px;text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase}#g-covidpolicies-web-Artboard_3 .g-pstyle2{text-align:center}#g-covidpolicies-web-Artboard_3 .g-pstyle3{font-weight:700;line-height:24px;font-size:20px;text-align:center;text-transform:uppercase}#g-covidpolicies-web-Artboard_3 .g-cstyle0{color:#ff110a}#g-covidpolicies-web-Artboard_3 .g-cstyle1{font-weight:700}#g-covidpolicies-web-Artboard_3 .g-cstyle2{color:#0000d4}#g-covidpolicies-web-Artboard_3 .g-cstyle3{color:#ff8515}</style> <div id="g-covidpolicies-web-box" class="ai2html">  <div id="g-covidpolicies-web-Artboard_1" class="g-artboard" style="width:600px;height:832px;" data-aspect-ratio="0.721" data-min-width="600" data-max-width="1199"> <div></div> <img id="g-covidpolicies-web-Artboard_1-img" class="g-aiImg g-covidpolicies-web-Artboard_1-img" alt="" src="covidpolicies-web-Artboard_1.aca2744a.jpg"> <div id="g-ai0-1" class="g-aiAbs g-Layer_1" style="top:1.4423%;left:49.9967%;margin-left:-41.3333%;width:82.6667%;"> <p class="g-pstyle0">Here&rsquo;s how Columbia and Barnard COVID-19 policies have differed:</p> </div> <div id="g-ai0-2" class="g-aiAbs g-Layer_1" style="transform:matrix(0,-1,1,0,0,0);transform-origin:50% 61.4081996434938%;-webkit-transform:matrix(0,-1,1,0,0,0);-webkit-transform-origin:50% 61.4081996434938%;-ms-transform:matrix(0,-1,1,0,0,0);-ms-transform-origin:50% 61.4081996434938%;top:19.0364%;margin-top:-4.4px;left:5.2569%;margin-left:-8.5%;width:17%;"> <p class="g-pstyle1">Masking</p> </div> <div id="g-ai0-3" class="g-aiAbs g-Layer_1" style="top:14.3029%;left:31.1972%;margin-left:-20.4167%;width:40.8333%;"> <p class="g-pstyle2">From the beginning of this semester to September 30, Columbia required masking in classrooms, while strongly recommending masking in other indoor settings.

They take classes, eat meals, and use facilities in the same spaces, as Izzy Lapidus, another junior at Barnard, pointed out. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “There’s a mandate for Barnard students to wear masks in Barnard classes, but then in Columbia classes, you don’t have to wear a mask,” said Lapidus, who takes classes on both campuses. “That doesn’t make sense, because there’s Barnard students and Columbia students in both classes.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Gerlach’s petition stated that the “practice of performing without masks is a standard that is upheld because the School of the Arts recognizes that their students pursuing degrees in acting need to be able to use their faces during performance”—identifying discrepant standards regarding masking between Columbia’s School of the Arts and theater productions on Barnard’s campus. It questioned, in other words, why students performing on Barnard’s campus were held to different standards than those on Columbia’s. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Throughout the pandemic, Gerlach has been outspoken about her frustrations regarding the discrepant policies between the two institutions’ COVID-19 policies—and Barnard’s more restrictive measures. Columbia students had little restriction on their activities, while their Barnard peers, according to Gerlach, have “had to jump through all these hoops” that didn’t exist for their peers across the street. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Barnard’s Public Health Response Team never responded to Gerlach’s petition, and actors in NOMADS had to perform their productions wearing a mask. Columbia’s COVID-19 policies have been created by Columbia Health, while Barnard’s COVID policies were created, in large part, by its Pandemic Response Team. Gerlach continues to wonder why the two schools have adopted such different policies. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Today, as the pandemic has eased in comparison to prior months, the two schools’ policies mirror one another more on some fronts. For instance, masking is now optional on both campuses. However, over the past two years, the institutions have adopted different attitudes across many of their policies, including masking, mandatory testing, symptom attestation, and even access to residence halls. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> In response to requests for comment from both schools’ pandemic response teams about various discrepancies in the schools’ policy—including masking, testing, and symptom attestation—The Eye received only one statement on behalf of both institutions, from a Barnard College spokesperson, explaining the discrepancies in the schools’ policies. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “When it comes to setting and implementing COVID-19 policies, our respective decision makers and pandemic response teams have always used data specific to our communities to inform actions and next steps, which means there are instances in which guidelines will not be identical,” the spokesperson wrote. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Nevertheless, adopting different COVID-19 policies has had ramifications across the student body. Especially because Barnard’s policies are almost always more conservative, Barnard students have faced greater challenges navigating COVID-19 policies than Columbia students. To Gerlach, at least, the difference represents a clear double standard. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <<<photo>>> </photo></p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> As students grew accustomed to following the rules from their respective campuses, Gerlach recounted how frustrating she found it to see Columbia students either forgetting or deliberately not following Barnard’s rules, such as masking, when on Barnard’s campus. Though Barnard is affiliated with Columbia, she emphasized, “We have our own rules.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Another central point of contention between the two schools’ COVID-19 policies has been the schools’ guests policies—with Barnard’s historically being more restrictive than Columbia’s. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> On September 2, an email from Barnard to its student body announced its latest COVID-19 policies, one of which prevented the presence of guests in Barnard dorms from 10 p.m. to 8 a.m. According to the email, the policy was “to mitigate the presence of COVID-19 on campus as students return to the residence halls and begin classes.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Lapidus found the rule arbitrary. “The emails made it seem like it was about COVID safety,” she told me. “But I just don’t get why—after 10 p.m., suddenly, COVID is more prominent? Or like, after 10 p.m.—what is that number supposed to mean? It just felt so random to me.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Especially because Columbia did not have an equivalent rule, Lapidus found the rule indicative of an unfair discrepancy between the two schools. She felt that the policy was “hurting the Barnard student experience in a way that Columbia students simply did not have to deal with.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Over the next week, outcry against the policy swept across both the Barnard and wider Columbia community, culminating in a formal petition to repeal the rule that garnered over 2700 signatures. The petition contended that the ban had sexist undertones, citing that Columbia’s co-ed student body was not subjected to such restrictions: “Columbia’s guest policy is applied to all Columbia schools with the exception of Barnard which is inequitable, and even misogynistic.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> The rule was revoked on September 9, a week after it was released. However, even after the policy was revoked, Barnard has maintained stricter rules of access into its residence halls than Columbia’s. At the time of reporting, Barnard’s restrictions on residence hall access include requiring that all guests complete a five-page questionnaire, attesting items such as vaccination status and symptoms, while guests at Columbia do not have to fill out a form to enter buildings. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Further, across the pandemic, both Barnard and Columbia monitored COVID-19 by rolling out mobile apps—CoVerified and ReopenCU, respectively—that track a student’s symptoms, positivity status, and so forth. At the height of the pandemic, both apps asked students to attest to, among other things, their COVID-19 positivity status, symptoms, and close contact status, granting students a “Green Pass” to access buildings if they fulfilled all requirements, and a “Red Pass” with deactivated swipe access if they did not. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> There is no doubt merit to launching systems that monitor and mitigate the spread of COVID-19, but the way these apps were rolled out revealed, not unlike other policies, another example of an inefficient policy impacting only Barnard students. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> In the 2021-22 academic year, Barnard students had to download two apps to access both campuses: To access Barnard’s campus, they had to use the CoVerified app; to access Columbia’s campus, they had to use the ReopenCU app. Columbia students, on the other hand, were permitted to use ReopenCU to access both campuses. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “I’d be running late to class, and my ID wouldn’t tap into a building,” Gerlach explained. “Great—which app is not working now?” The problem, generated by the discrepancy in policy between schools, was specific to Barnard—an obstacle Columbia students would not have faced. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> This semester, to attain a green pass on ReopenCU, Columbia students had to complete a one-off activation process with a few steps, such as signing the Health Compact and uploading vaccine documentation. To maintain a green pass on CoVerified, however, Barnard students are mandated to test as frequently as once every two weeks. If they fail to test, they receive a red pass and are denied access to Barnard spaces, including their own dorms. In other words, Columbia students do not need to test to access Barnard’s spaces, but Barnard students do. </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “If Barnard is going to scrutinize us for accessing spaces and trying to get into places,” Gerlach said, “they should do the same for Columbia.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Broadly, the discrepancy in policy generates tangible consequences for students at both schools. For Lapidus, the effects are felt on a social level. Though Barnard and Columbia are different schools, she said, “we all go to school together, and therefore, what our dorm rules look like or what hanging out in a group setting looks like—all of that should be the same across both campuses.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “Why are the policies different?” she said. “I think, at this point, it’d make the most sense that they were the same, since the student body winds up being so similar—at least in the parts in which it does overlap.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> Lapidus said that, at the very least, she wanted the two schools to be more transparent about their decision-making processes. For policies that so strongly shape social interactions between students of both schools, she hoped for more information about how, and why, the schools make the decisions that they do. “I’m impacted by Columbia’s policies,as a Barnard student,” she said. “And Columbia students are impacted by Barnard’s policies.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> “I just wish that they were more in communication with each other,” Lapidus said, “and thought about how it affects the student body when they have these differences in policies.” </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <i>Mayra Kalaora contributed reporting.</i> </p> <p class="g-body paragraph"> <i>Eye Managing Editor Derek Ng can be contacted at </i><a href="mailto:derek.ng@columbiaspectator.com"><i>derek.ng@columbiaspectator.com</i></a><i>.

It questioned, in other words, why students performing on Barnard’s campus were held to different standards than those on Columbia’s."

The petition contended that the ban had sexist undertones, citing that Columbia’s co-ed student body was not subjected to such restrictions: “Columbia’s guest policy is applied to all Columbia schools with the exception of Barnard which is inequitable, and even misogynistic.”"

However, even after the policy was revoked, Barnard has maintained stricter rules of access into its residence halls than Columbia’s. At the time of reporting, Barnard’s restrictions on residence hall access include requiring that all guests complete a five-page questionnaire, attesting items such as vaccination status and symptoms, while guests at Columbia do not have to fill out a form to enter buildings."

At the height of the pandemic, both apps asked students to attest to, among other things, their COVID-19 positivity status, symptoms, and close contact status, granting students a “Green Pass” to access buildings if they fulfilled all requirements, and a “Red Pass” with deactivated swipe access if they did not."

To maintain a green pass on CoVerified, however, Barnard students are mandated to test as frequently as once every two weeks. If they fail to test, they receive a red pass and are denied access to Barnard spaces, including their own dorms. In other words, Columbia students do not need to test to access Barnard’s spaces, but Barnard students do."
